# STS ModLoader #
Currently supported version: `[EARLY_ACCESS_011] (01-09-2018) BETA`

Note: Patches may not be fully up to date, they are currently manually generated. I generally try to update the patches each time a new beta version is released.

## Install instructions: ##
1. Clone repo
2. Grab desktop-1.0.jar from your Slay the Spire steam folder and do one of the following:
  * Apply the JDF patch to it with JojoDiff (http://jojodiff.sourceforge.net/)
  * Extact the classes there are diff files for, decompile (CFR 124), apply diffs, recompile, put back in the JAR
3. Run with "java -jar desktop-1.0.jar" to get logger output
